// .sks files are archived in SKEmitterNode instances. Our
// property changes in the Xcode particle editor actually
// changes real properties on this kind of node.
//
// We will need to retrieve a copy of that node by loading 
// it from the app bundle. In order to mimic the API that
// Apple uses for sound actions, we will build a swift extension
// to add a new method to the SKEmitterNode class to unarchive
// our .sks file.
//
// This was called a category in Objective-C, but is called
// an extension in Swift.

// Use a Swift extension to extend the String class to have our
// own defined length property.
